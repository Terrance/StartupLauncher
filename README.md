Introduction
------------

This Startup Launcher is a customizable application launcher designed for listing programs you like to launch when you start your computer, without slowing your computer's boot time by starting them automatically.  No user interface for editing shortcuts yet, you need to manually edit the **blocks.js** file. In order to make the app appear when you log in to your computer, you will need to add a shortcut to **launcher.hta** in the Startup folder of the Start Menu.
